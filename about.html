                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <p>YDT Dance Club was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a space where every individual can express themselves through the beautiful art of dance. What started as a small group of dance enthusiasts has now grown into one of the most vibrant and dynamic clubs on campus.</p>
                        <p>Our motto "YDT zindabad tha, zindabad hai, aur ZINDABAD rahegaa!" reflects our unwavering spirit and commitment to excellence. We believe that dance is not just movement; it's a language that speaks to the soul, a form of expression that transcends boundaries, and a way to connect with others on a deeper level.</p>
